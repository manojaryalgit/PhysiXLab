## üéÆ Available Simulations

### Projectile Motion
Simulate the motion of projectiles under gravity. Adjust initial velocity, angle, and height to see how they affect the trajectory.

### Collision Simulator
Explore elastic and inelastic collisions between objects. Adjust mass, velocity, and elasticity to see how they affect the outcome.

### Simple Harmonic Motion
Visualize the oscillatory motion of a mass-spring system. Adjust spring constant, mass, and initial displacement to see their effects.

### Pendulum Motion
Study the motion of a simple pendulum. Change length, mass, and initial angle to observe different oscillation patterns.

### Wave Interference
Explore wave superposition and interference patterns. Adjust wavelength, amplitude, and phase to create different patterns.

### Light Refraction
Simulate light refraction through different media. Change incident angle and refractive indices to observe Snell's law in action.

### Circular Motion
Study uniform circular motion and centripetal force. Adjust radius, velocity, and mass to see their effects on the motion.
